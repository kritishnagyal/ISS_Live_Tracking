## üåç Project Overview

This project demonstrates how Python can be used to **track the International Space Station (ISS)** in real time. It includes geospatial analysis, orbital predictions, and visualization tools. The final result is an interactive dashboard using **Streamlit** and **Folium** that shows the ISS‚Äôs real-time position, speed, altitude, and next visible passes over any location.

### üî≠ What You'll Learn

- Working with **live Two-Line Element (TLE)** data from CelesTrak
- Predicting **ISS pass times** for any location on Earth
- Plotting **ground tracks** and orbital paths using **Skyfield** and **Cartopy**
- Creating a **dashboard UI** using **Streamlit**
- Exporting ISS passes to CSV for multiple cities
